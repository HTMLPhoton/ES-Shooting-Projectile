# ES-Shooting-Projectile
Data and images for a projectile that shoots projectiles using a system that supports recursion

Files:
data/ - containes the data for a weapon that shoots projectiles, that in turn, shoots projectiles
images/ - containes the sprites used.
drone.html - a html document i used to generate part of the data due to sanity reasons.


What you should expect if you compiled everything into a plugin:
there would be a new weapon named "Drone Deployer". it is only obtainable through save editing and launches kamakize combat drones with javelin pods.
